    <h1>Case Study: Email Privacy</h1>

    <p>There are many obvious similarities between email, mail, and telephone calls. All three are popular forms of communication, yet since the personal computer revolution, modern forms of electronic communication, including email, have been on the rise, while conventional communication methods have declined. Despite the increased prevalence of email, it has one glaring problem.</p>

    <p>Unlike traditional mail or phone calls, which require law enforcement officials to obtain a search warrant to gain access to, email can be accessed <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703">without a search warrant</a> unless the messages are less than 180 days old or have not been opened.</p>

    <p>This law, set forth in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, ensures that government agencies only need a subpoena to force email providers to give up their customers' email.</p> 

    <h2><a name="requests">Surveillance Request Rates on the Rise</a></h2>

    <p>Google, one of the world's largest email and content providers, publishes a <a href="http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/">transparency report</a> every six months, in which the company breaks down the number of requests for user data or data removal by governments and courts around the world. </p>

    <p>In the latest period, from January to June 2012, Google disclosed that there were over twenty thousand requests for data worldwide, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/11/14/google_transparency_report_shows_government_surveillance_takedown_requests.html">55% increase</a> over the previous year. The United States accounted for more than one third of total data requests. Is this the beginning of the surveillance state in the U.S.?</p>

    <p>Ryan Gallagher of Slate suggests that this jump in surveillance and censorship around the world corresponds to calls by governments for more powerful surveillance laws. For example, in the United States, a proposed amendment to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act backed by the FBI would require that providers of voice over IP, instant messaging, and email services enforce that their products are <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57428067-83/fbi-we-need-wiretap-ready-web-sites-now/">easy to wire-tap</a>. 

    <p>Glenn Greenwald, a former practicioner of Constitutional law and writer for Salon, insists that this legislation is similar to <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/05/06/surveillance_state_democracy/">Saudi Arabian legislation</a> which cut off key services for BlackBerry users in 2010 after Research In Motion, the creator of the BlackBerry, refused to allow the Saudi government to access encrypted messages sent using BlackBerry products. 

    <p>While this legislation has thankfully not been passed, it reflects a growing interest by the United States government and law enforcement in increasing cybersurveillance across the country. 

    <h2><a name="petraeus">The Petraeus Affair</a></h2>

    <p>In November 2012, Gen. David Petraeus <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/12/politics/petraeus-timeline/index.html">stepped down</a> as the director of the CIA after a series of leaked email exchanges led to an FBI investigation which exposed an extra-marital affair between Petraeus and his biographer, Paula Broadwell. 
    Gen. Petraeus's inability to keep his emails private does not bode well for the majority of email users throughout the United States. As framed by <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9234168/Petraeus_affair_reveals_risks_of_email">Sharon Gaudin</a> of Computerworld, "If the head of the CIA can't figure out how to keep his emails private, do the rest of us even stand a chance?"

    <p>Unfortunately, the answer to this question is most likely no. Although proxies can be used to attempt to hide the bread-crumb trail left by emails as they pass through mail servers and routers, they are rarely used. Gen. Petraeus attempted to use a pseudonym to hide his identity, along with multiple anonymous gmail accounts, however FBI agents were still able to link Broadwell and Petraeus to their correspondences by <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3003061/real-cyberforensics-used-snoop-petraeus-and-you">matching IP addresses</a> stored by Google to physical locations where Broadwell and Petraeus were known to be.
