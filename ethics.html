    <h1>The Ethical Basis for Privacy</h1>
    <h2><a name="proargs">Arguments for privacy</a></h2>
      <p>From an ethical standpoint, one typically considers privacy to be a "good." There are a few arguments to this effect; the first is that privacy is essential for human dignity and individual autonomy. In this frame, privacy is an inalienable right of humans and to deny a person privacy is to deny them their humanity.</p>

      <p>Another argument is that privacy is essential for the development of interpersonal relationships; without privacy, one would be unable to form an intimate relationship with another individual. Others take the reductionist viewpoint that one's personal information is one's property, and therefore privacy falls without the bounds of property rights. Utilitarians see a trade-off: the happiness of the individual (attained by increasing privacy) must be balanced with happiness of the masses (attained by decreasing privacy in exchange for security).</p>
