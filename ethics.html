    <h1>The Ethical Basis for Privacy</h1>
    <h2><a name="proargs">Arguments for privacy</a></h2>
      <p>From an ethical standpoint, one typically considers privacy to be a "good." There are a few arguments to this effect; the first is that privacy is essential for human dignity and individual autonomy. In this frame, privacy is an inalienable right of humans and to deny a person privacy is to deny them their humanity.</p>
