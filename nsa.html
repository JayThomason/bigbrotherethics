    <h1>Civilian Surveillance and the NSA</h1>

    <p>The National Security Agency (NSA), according to its <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/about/mission/index.shtml">mission statement</a>, "leads the U.S. Government in cryptology that encompasses both Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Information Assurance (IA) products and services, and enables Computer Network Operations (CNO) in order to gain a decision advantage for the Nation and our allies under all circumstances."</p> 
    <p>Despite this somewhat mundane description, the United States government agency with the greatest similarity to Orwell.s Big Brother is undoubtedly the NSA. This is primarily because the NSA has a well-documented civilian surveillance program in place. It is likely that they are capturing and recording the very packets which transferred this webpage to your browser when you loaded it.</p> 

    <a name="surveillance"><h2>The Surveillance Program</h2></a>

    <p>The NSA's civilian cyber-surveillance efforts were first brought to the attention of the media in <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/homefront/etc/kleindoc.pdf"> 2004</a>, when an engineer working at AT&T in San Francisco blew the whistle on AT&T's illegal cooperation with the NSA. The engineer, a man by the name of Mark Klein, alleged that the previous year AT&T constructed so-called .secret rooms. within its central offices across the United States.</p>
    <p>Within these rooms, devices known as 'splitters' were used to tap into and split the signals coming down AT&T's fiber-optic backbone. Since AT&T has one of the largest networks in the United states, the use of splitters allows the NSA to double all signals coming down the wire, while sending one set of signals on their way, while diverting the other set of signals. Klein alleged that the internet traffic was being diverted not only to traffic analyzers, but to a central control station, which he hypothesized was in Virginia. While Klein may have been correct in 2004, as of 2013, it is likely that the NSA's traffic monitoring and analysis headquarters are actually in Utah.</p>
    <p>Perhaps most tellingly, although the domestic surveillance program was discovered in 2004, <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/nsa-denies-wired/">the government has still not acknowledged its existence</a> as of 2012.</p>

    <h2><a name="datacenter">The NSA's Surveillance Datacenter</a></h2>

    <p>In March 2012, <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/"> James Bamford of Wired</a> reported that a top secret datacenter was under construction, funded by the NSA. In his article, Bamford writes that the datacenter, which costs over $2 billion, will be operational by September 2013. However, senior intelligence officials involved in the program argue that this project involves more than just a datacenter.</p> 
    <p>One unnamed official claims that the datacenter and the supercomputers that it houses will be .critical for breaking codes,. allowing the NSA to decrypt the massive amounts of encrypted communications captured in its wiretapping programs.</p> 
    <p>The NSA refuses to acknowledge this usage. NSA deputy director Chris Inglis told reporters this year that the center is, .a state-of-the-art facility designed to support the intelligence community in its mission to". protect the nation.s cybersecurity" Interestingly, the director of the project is Glenn A. Gaffney, the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/about-cia/leadership/index.html">deputy director of national intelligence for collection</a>. If the purpose of the datacenter was truly to promote cybersecurity, it would be fitting that the director be involved in cybersecurity, not intelligence gathering.</p>

    <h2><a name="stellarwind">Codename: Stellar Wind</a></h2>

    <p>Bill Binney, a former senior official at the NSA, claims that he left the agency after it began violating the constitution in the name of <a href="http://www.phantomreport.com/us-data-whistleblower-widespread-civilian-surveillance">domestic intelligence gathering</a>. Furthermore, Binney claims that an operation known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind_%28code_name%29">Stellar Wind</a> began shortly after 2001 involves mining a massive dataset consisting of domestic phone calls, emails, and internet traffic. In fact, Binney claims that Stellar Wind is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/sep/15/data-whistleblower-constitutional-rights"> an attempt to, </a>"collect virtually all electronic data in the country, from Facebook posts to Google searches and emails" In addition to AT&T's cooperation, it is believed that Verizon is complicit in Stellar Wind, leading Binney to estimate that the NSA is monitoring at least 1.5 billion calls each day, in addition to untold amounts of internet traffic. Addriene Kinne, a former NSA voice interceptor, admitted that the NSA has the ability to listen in on almost any call at any time. Kinne considers this domestic eavesdropping <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/video?id=5992459"> distressing</a>.</p>
    <p>The NSA's Utah datacenter is expected to become the new home of Stellar Wind with its completion in 2013.</p>

    <h2><a name="crypto">Decryption and Code-breaking</a></h2>

    <p>In 2004, DARPA began the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Productivity_Computing_Systems">High Productivity Computing Systems program</a> in order to develop the fastest supercomputers in the world. When the Department of Energy created the world.s then-fastest supercomputer in 2009 under this program, the NSA allegedly created a similar computer which was even faster. Perhaps more frighteningly, the NSA's supercomputer was meant to break codes.</p>
    <p>According to one former senior intelligence official who oversaw the program, the NSA's machine was .modified for cryptanalysis and targeted against one or more specific algorithms, including the AES.</p>
    <p>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a 128, 192, or 256 bit symmetric key encryption standard, which acts as the official encryption specification used by the U.S. government. All attacks on even AES-128 are widely believed to be computationally impossible. One <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2102435/aes-encryption-cracked">cryptographic researcher explains</a>: .on a trillion machines, that each could test a billion keys per second, it would take more than two billion years to recover and AES-128 key" The NSA wants to change that.</p>
    While <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/03/can_the_nsa_bre.html"> security experts doubt</a> that the NSA will crack AES with a brute-force attack, it is possible that the supercomputers being built by the NSA can be used in tandem with the data provided by the NSA's surveillance programs to break AES. 
    If the NSA does manage to crack AES, then it will gain access to a massive treasure-trove of data which was previously encrypted. Furthermore, it will become increasingly difficult to protect your private data. New encryption standards will need to be devised and advocated while your privacy remains in the balance.
