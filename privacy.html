    <h1>What is Privacy?</h1>

    <p>Philosophically, there's something of a debate about as to how to define privacy. Some argue that privacy should be defined as unintrusion, that privacy is violated when a person's seclusion or solitude is intruded upon. Others argue that privacy is a restriction of access and that one's privacy is exclusive access to one's own "realm." This definition is somewhat problematic, as it leaves open to interpretation the size and scope of one's personal "realm."</p> 
    
    <p> Probably the most pertinent definition to the general conception of technological privacy today is that of privacy as control over information about oneself. As emails, browsing history, online identity, and a host of other factors can be classified as information about oneself, it's easy to see how widely applicable this definition is to our modern conception of privacy and its interaction with technology.  </p>
