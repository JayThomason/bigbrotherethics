    <h1>Electronic Privacy FAQ</h1>
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can the government read my email without a warrant?</p>
    <p class="answer">If the email is older than 180 days, then yes. Otherwise they need a warrant. However, the government can read the headers of your email without a warrant, and it is up to them to discard the content of the messages if they do not have authorization to read it.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can the government listen to my phone calls without a warrant?</p>

    <p class="answer">No, the government cannot eavesdrop on your phone calls without a warrant. However, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the government can obtain a warrant to eavesdrop on your phonecalls with a lesser burden of proof than a traditional warrant. All that the government has to prove is that you are working for a foreign power and you communications can be tapped.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can the government know who I talk with on the phone without a warrant?</p>

    <p class="answer">Yes, they can get this information with just a subpoena. Any routing info, header info, etc... that isn’t ‘content’ can be obtained through subpoena. This was established in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act">USA Patriot Act</a> as an extension of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act">Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> of 1986.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can the government track my location through my cell phone without a warrant?</p>

    <p class="answer">Yes, but they still have to prove ‘reasonable suspicion’, which is a less stringent standard of evidence than probable cause.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can the government go through my trash without my permission?</p>

    <p class="answer">Yes, as long as you place your trash in a dumpster accessible to the general public. If you must discard sensitive documents, shred or burn them first.</p>
