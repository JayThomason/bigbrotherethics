    <h1>A Legal History of Privacy</h1>
    <h2><a name="fourthamendment">The 4th Amendment</a></h2>
    <p>The 4th amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads:</p>

    <blockquote>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote>  
    <p>The 4th amendment is used to create system of ‘warrants’, where police have to obtain written permission from a court before searching or seizing property. To obtain a warrant, the requesting party must establish ‘probable cause’, meaning that it is reasonable to believe that the search will yield evidence.</p>

    <p>Over the decades, the Supreme court has interpreted the Fourth Amendment’s text as explicitly protecting privacy as control over one’s personal information. As such it has been instrumental in guiding new legislation for privacy and technology. However, the Fourth Amendment is part of the Bill of Rights, which was drafted in 1789. It's hard to imagine the founding fathers had email in mind when designing this amendment protecting against unreasonable search and seizure. While progressing technology creates more and more expectations of privacy and opportunities for that privacy to be violated, the Fourth Amendment is applied in more and more ways that it was not intended to be applied. Indeed, the Fourth Amendment is hardly a solid foundation for privacy in the modern age.</p>

    <h2><a name="katzvusa">Katz vs. USA - 1967</a></h2>
    <p>In 1967 Charles Katz was using a public phone booth to phone in illegal gambling wagers. Unbeknownst to him, he was also being recorded by an eavesdropping device attached to the outside of the phone booth by the FBI. Katz was convicted based on recordings gathered by the device but he appealed his conviction, arguing that the recordings were obtained in a manner that violated his fourth amendment rights. His appeal made it to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Katz, making electronic wiretapping subject to the warrant requirements of the Fourth Amendment.</p>

    <p>The ruling in Katz vs USA established a two-part test for determining the privacy of a situation. First, the individual must have a subjective expectation of privacy in the situation. So, in the case of Charles Katz, he had an expectation that his conversations could not be heard outside of the phone booth once he closed its door. The second requirement is that society at large must recognize that this expectation is reasonable, so society must also agree with Mr. Katz. This two-part test is still used extensively today in privacy litigation</p>
